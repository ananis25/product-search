Some of the things here are very cool!

- Content based recommendation rather than Collaborative filtering over user-item interactions. Unlike consumables / media, electronic purchases have a lot more config to tune. Also, expensive so the cost of a poor recommendation is high. 

- User preferences are serializable. 

- Expert evaluation - reduces chance of a bad purchase. Also, homogenizes the quality of a product on each important aspect (camera quality, travel friends, etc.). Ensures baseline quality of the products displayed on here. 

# Technical challenges
* Keeping data updated. Prices and offers. A lot of shopping around something like Black Friday, and dynamic prices. 
* Learning to rank, which attributes are important how much. 
* Attributes are 

# Things I am curious about
- To what extent ML is useful. 
    - Very curious about how ads might be run. Given 
    - Assuming specific product segments (phones, laptops, etc.) and less general e-commerce like Amazon. The number of products can't be too large while verifying quality. Useful when ranking though. 
    - Exploration: identifying what are the aspects of a product that are important to the user. 

- Growth: how to make people use it. 

- Running auction ads! Finding relevant ads is a a lot easier compared to a shopping website since the user representation is more concrete. However, most relevant items are likely to show up in our recommendations anyway! There must be theory on how to balance both. Amazon started serving those in 2018. 
- Are there existing APIs or marketplaces you could directly plug into? Do you bill for impressions or clicks?
